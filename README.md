Pots 'n' Posies is an online plant store using Adobe XD tool.
I have tried designing a good-quality website with a combination of simple and creative ideas.
The idea was to build a community of nature lovers by helping them pick the right plants. 
Keeping this in mind, the website is done with earthy colours. 
Green is used to draw in plant lovers. All design elements are minimal, right from the font itself to the use of linear icons.
